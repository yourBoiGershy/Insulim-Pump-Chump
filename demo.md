## High-Level Object-Oriented Design for Insulin Pump Simulator

### Core Design Structure Based on t:slim X2 Requirements

*Reference: See UML Class Diagram in `design/class_diagram.png`*

Our insulin pump simulator implements the Tandem t:slim X2 functionality through a modular architecture with several key components:

1. **Home Screen System**
   - Central hub for monitoring insulin delivery, battery life, and CGM data
   - Displays critical indicators (battery, insulin remaining, IOB)
   - Provides navigation to other functional areas

2. **Profile Management System (CRUD)**
   - Implements the required personal profiles functionality
   - Stores multiple profiles with different settings (basal rates, carb ratios, etc.)
   - Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting profiles

3. **Bolus Administration System**
   - Calculates insulin doses based on carbs and glucose readings
   - Supports extended bolus functionality
   - Integrates with Control-IQ technology for automated adjustments

4. **Continuous Glucose Monitoring**
   - Simulates and displays glucose readings at 5-minute intervals
   - Provides visualization through graphs with different time ranges
   - Maintains history of readings for analysis

5. **Insulin Delivery Control**
   - Manages starting, stopping, and resuming insulin delivery
   - Implements automatic suspension for low glucose
   - Tracks insulin on board and its effect on glucose levels

### Mediator Pattern Implementation

*Reference: See Component Diagram in `design/component_diagram.png`*

We've implemented the Mediator pattern to coordinate interactions between these complex components:

```
                  ┌─────────────────┐
                  │                 │
                  │ SimulationCore  │
                  │    Mediator     │
                  │                 │
                  └─────────────────┘
                         ▲  ▲  ▲
                         │  │  │
         ┌───────────────┘  │  └───────────────┐
         │                  │                  │
         ▼                  ▼                  ▼
┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │ │                 │ │                 │
│ Glucose Monitor │ │ Profile Manager │ │ Insulin Delivery│
│                 │ │                 │ │                 │
└─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘
```

The mediator centralizes complex interactions such as:
- How profile changes affect insulin calculations
- How insulin administration impacts glucose levels
- How Control-IQ technology adjusts insulin based on glucose trends

### Benefits of Our Design for t:slim X2 Simulation

1. **Accurate Representation**: Our design directly maps to the t:slim X2 pump's functionality as described in the specifications

2. **Safety Features**: Implements critical safety operations like automatic suspension for low glucose

3. **Data Visualization**: Provides the required graphing and history functionality

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Architecture supports both unit testing and scenario-based testing

5. **Reduced Coupling**: The mediator pattern minimizes dependencies between components

### Demo Highlights

## Implementation Overview

### Flow of Control for Key Scenarios

*Reference: See Sequence Diagrams in `sequence_diagrams.md`*

#### 1. Manual Bolus Administration

The flow follows a clear user-centered path:

```
User Action → UI Event → Business Logic → Data Update → Visual Feedback
```

When a user administers insulin:
1. The UI captures the input (carbs, glucose)
2. The active profile's settings determine the calculation
3. The insulin affects the simulated glucose levels
4. The graph and displays update to show the effects

This demonstrates how user actions propagate through the system layers, with each component handling its specific responsibility.

#### 2. Profile Management

The profile management flow demonstrates the CRUD pattern:

```
User Selection → Data Retrieval → UI Display → User Modification → Data Persistence
```

Profiles move through a complete lifecycle:
1. Creation with default or user-specified settings
2. Storage in persistent memory
3. Retrieval when needed
4. Application to insulin calculations
5. Modification as user needs change

### Design Patterns in Implementation

#### Observer Pattern (Qt's Signal/Slot)

Qt's signal/slot mechanism forms the backbone of our communication system:

```
Component A (Signal) -----> Component B (Slot)
```

Key examples:
- Timers signal the simulation to update glucose values
- Bolus administration signals glucose level changes
- Profile changes signal updates to insulin calculations

This creates a loosely-coupled system where components react to events without direct dependencies.

#### Mediator Pattern

The MainWindow class acts as a mediator between major components:

```
           ┌─── MainWindow ───┐
           │                  │
           ▼                  ▼
    Profile System      Glucose System
```

It coordinates navigation between screens and facilitates communication between otherwise independent components.

#### Strategy Pattern

The profile system implements different insulin delivery strategies:

```
Profile ──┬── Morning Strategy
          ├── Exercise Strategy
          └── Night Strategy
```

Each profile contains different parameters that alter how insulin is calculated and delivered, allowing the system to adapt to different situations without changing its core logic.

#### State Pattern

The simulation exists in different states (running, paused) that alter its behavior:

```
Simulation ──┬── Running State
             └── Paused State
```

The UI and data generation respond differently based on the current state, providing appropriate feedback and control to the user.

These patterns work together to create a flexible, maintainable system that accurately simulates the t:slim X2 insulin pump while maintaining good separation of concerns and minimizing dependencies between components.

## Testing Strategy

*Reference: See Test Plan in `testing/test_plan.md` and State Machine Diagrams in `design/state_diagrams/`*

### Testing Approach

Our testing strategy follows a comprehensive multi-level approach:

```
Unit Tests → Integration Tests → System Tests → Scenario-Based Tests
```

#### Unit Testing

We've implemented unit tests for core components using Qt Test framework:

   - Verify time segment calculations
   - Validate profile switching functionality

2. **Glucose Simulation Tests**
   - Test glucose calculation algorithms
   - Verify insulin impact on glucose levels
   - Validate time simulation accuracy

3. **Bolus Calculator Tests**
   - Test insulin dose calculations
   - Verify carb ratio and correction factor application
   - Validate IOB considerations

#### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify interactions between components:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ Profile     │───>│ Bolus       │───>│ Glucose     │
│ Component   │    │ Component   │    │ Component   │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
       ↑                                     │
       └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

   - Test extended bolus impact over time

#### Scenario-Based Testing

We've implemented automated tests for key scenarios from the requirements:

1. **Manual Bolus Scenario**
   - Test complete workflow from carb entry to glucose impact
   - Verify calculations match expected results

2. **Profile Management Scenario**
   - Test creating, editing, and switching between profiles
   - Verify persistence between application sessions

3. **Control-IQ Scenario**
   - Test automatic insulin adjustments based on glucose trends

## Requirements Traceability

*Reference: See Requirements Traceability Matrix in `docs/traceability_matrix.xlsx`*

Our Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) provides bidirectional traceability between:

1. **Requirements**: Derived from the t:slim X2 specifications
2. **Design Elements**: Classes and components in our architecture
3. **Implementation**: Specific code files and functions
4. **Tests**: Test cases that verify each requirement

### Matrix Structure

The RTM is organized as follows:

```
┌────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┐
│ Requirement ID │ Design Element │ Implementation │ Test Case      │
├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤
│ REQ-001        │ HomeScreen     │ home.cpp       │ TC-HOME-001    │
│ Glucose Display│ GlucoseMonitor │ drawGraph()    │ testGlucoseVis │
├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤
│ REQ-002        │ ProfileManager │ profile.cpp    │ TC-PROF-001    │
│ Profile CRUD   │ ProfileEditor  │ saveProfile()  │ testProfileMgmt│
└────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┘
```

### Traceability Benefits

1. **Completeness Verification**: Ensures all requirements are implemented and tested
